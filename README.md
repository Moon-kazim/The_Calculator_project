# The CALCULATOR Project

#TODO: Write out the other 4 functions - addition, subtract, multiply and divide.
#TODO: Add these 4 functions into a dictionary as the values. Keys = "+", "-", "*", "/"
#TODO: Use the dictionary operations to perform the calculations. Multiply 4 * 8 using the dictionary.


#Functionality
#Program asks the user to type the first number.
#Program asks the user to type a mathematical operator (a choice of "+", "-", "*" or "/")
#Program asks the user to type the second number.
#Program works out the result based on the chosen mathematical operator.
#Program asks if the user wants to continue working with the previous result.
#If yes, program loops to use the previous result as the first number and then repeats the calculation process.
#If no, program asks the user for the fist number again and wipes all memory of previous calculations.
